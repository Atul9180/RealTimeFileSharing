## Features
- User-friendly interface for easy file management and sharing
- Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms for user access control
- Real-time updates and notifications for seamless collaboration
- Integration with MongoDB and Mongoose ODM for efficient and scalable data storage
- Support for various file formats, including documents, images, and videos
- Efficient file sharing and downloading functionalities
- Advanced search and filtering options for quick file retrieval

## Technologies Used
~ MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for efficient and scalable file storage
~ Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a simplified way to interact with the database
~ Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development
~ Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js
~ Socket.io: A JavaScript library for real-time communication between the server and clients
